Hi! I go by the name iBruteforce Online. I currently work as a Security Analyst. My primary hobby is to partipate on Capture the Flag (CTF) and CrowdSourced Bug Bounty Programs. Occasionaly, I like to blog about some of the interesting vulnerabilities that I find during my engagements. 

In my time participating in bug bounties, I've helped fix several critical vulnerabilities on Fortune 500 companies such as AT&T, Marriott and MailRu.

Some of my BugBounty Stats:
